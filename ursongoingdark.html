    <h2>I created this because I hated my iPad stand I had before. </h2>
<ol>
<li>I first tried to create it using a joint I tried to make in Fusion 360 but I failed. </li>
<li>I then decided to buy some joints off of Monotaro and found the ones I was looking for.</li>
<li>I connected the joints with some acrylic pieces I cut using the laser printer.</li>

<h2> Here is the PPT I used to document what I did.</h2>
