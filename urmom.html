    <h2>I had to make a PPT about how power and culutre will lead to progress.</h2>

<ul>
<li>I thought progress was defined as “a movement to an improved or more developed state”. </li>
<li>Power is given to a person when they can promise the citizens sustainabiliy, security and peace.</li>
<li>There's no telling whether how long you will live with cancer or if you will survive it.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Here is the PPT I used to present what I researched.</h2>
